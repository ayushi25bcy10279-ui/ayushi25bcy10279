# PROBELM STATEMENT
Managing events manually often leads to confusion, errors, and inefficiency. 
Event organizers must handle multiple tasks at the same time, such as maintaining participant details, scheduling activities, allocating venues, and keeping track of updates. 
When this information is recorded on paper or in scattered files, it becomes difficult to organize, retrieve, or modify data quickly.
As the number of participants or events increases, the chances of miscommunication and data loss also rise. 
There is a need for a simple, reliable, and automated system that can store event information in an organized manner, reduce manual work, and ensure accuracy. 
A Python-based Event Management System can address these challenges by providing a centralized platform where event-related data can be created, updated, and managed efficiently. 
This system aims to streamline event coordination and improve overall productivity for both organizers and participants.
